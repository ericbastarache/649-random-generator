# 649-random-generator

Random number generator for Lotto 649

## Please note! This is not a perfect generator, it WILL NOT guarantee you a winning lottery ticket! This generator simply generates 6 random numbers from 1 - 49 for the Lotto 649. So, if you have problems coming up with numbers yourself, this generator will generate 52 sets of numbers for the lottery.

This is just the source code for it in case anyone wants to know what it does. To run this program you must do the following: 

1. Navigate to C:\directorywhereyousavedtheprogram\Lotto Gen V1.1.2\Lotto Gen V1.1.2\bin\Debug\Lotto Gen V1.1.2.exe
2. Double click the file to run it
3. That's it! You should now have a text file on your desktop called "lottonums.txt". That file contains all the sets of lottery numbers you generated.

If you would like a version you can install, new features to be added, a GUI application, or simply to inquire about other software applications or services I offer, you may contact me at eric_bastarache@hotmail.com
